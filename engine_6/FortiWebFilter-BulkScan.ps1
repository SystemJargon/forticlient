## Created as Fortinet do not have a bulk URL scan utility nor any friendly API which exists for their webfilter.

## What this script does / things to understand?

## In your C:\users\username folder, you will have a folder called FortiWebFilter-BulkScan\ created.
## Also you will have a text file called addresses.txt created in this new folder above.
## Open addresses.txt. Place domains/urls - 1 per line to scan via Fortinet's webfilter.
## The script will in console (in the ps window) and via output file save any results. The output file is "webfilter-output.txt"


# Full path of the file
$file = "$env:USERPROFILE\FortiWebFilter-BulkScan\addresses.txt"

#Full path to the archiving folder
$WorkingDir = "$env:USERPROFILE\FortiWebFilter-BulkScan"

# If the file exists, do nothing, else create it.

        ## If the Working directory does not exist, create it now.

            $null = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $WorkingDir -ErrorAction STOP

        ## Other actions we can place here if needed in the future
